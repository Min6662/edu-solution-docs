## Response to App Store Rejection Issues

### Issue 1: Guideline 5.1.1(v) - Data Collection and Storage
**Problem:** The app supports account creation but does not include an option to initiate account deletion.

**Solution:** **Account creation has been completely DISABLED** to address this concern.

### Issue 2: Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed
**Problem:** Newly created accounts could access student data inappropriately.

**Solution:** **Public registration has been REMOVED** to prevent unauthorized access.

## App Architecture Now

### User Access Control
1. **Admin-Only Account Creation**: Only school administrators can create user accounts
2. **Role-Based Access**: Users are assigned specific roles (admin, teacher, student)
3. **No Public Registration**: Eliminates security vulnerabilities
4. **Controlled Access**: Student data is only accessible to authorized school personnel

### Account Management
- **Teacher Accounts**: Created and managed by school administrators
- **Student Accounts**: Created and managed by school administrators  
- **Admin Accounts**: Created by existing administrators
- **No Self-Registration**: Public cannot create accounts

---

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Protection**: Student information is only accessible to authorized school staff
2. **Access Control**: All accounts are vetted and approved by school administration
3. **Compliance**: Eliminates privacy concerns about unauthorized data access
4. **Audit Trail**: All account creation is controlled and traceable

## App Store Guidelines Compliance

### Guideline 5.1.1(v) - RESOLVED
- ✅ No public account creation = No account deletion requirement
- ✅ Only institutional accounts managed by administrators
- ✅ No user-generated accounts that would require deletion options

### Guideline 2.1 - RESOLVED  
- ✅ No newly created accounts can access student data
- ✅ All accounts are pre-authorized by school administration
- ✅ Student data access is restricted to verified school personnel only

---

## App Purpose Clarification

This is an **internal school management application** designed for:
- School administrators to manage institutional data
- Teachers to track attendance and manage classes
- Students to view their academic information

**The app is NOT intended for public use** and should only be used by authorized school personnel with administrator-created accounts.

---

## Technical Implementation

The signup functionality has been disabled by:
1. Commenting out signup navigation in login screens
2. Removing signup buttons from user interface
3. Maintaining signup code as commented for potential future administrative features
4. Adding clear documentation about the compliance changes

All existing functionality remains intact while eliminating the security vulnerability of public account creation.

**App Store Review Team:** The app now complies with both guidelines by eliminating public account creation entirely. This resolves both the account deletion requirement and unauthorized data access concerns.
