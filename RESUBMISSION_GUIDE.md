## 📝 **Response to Apple Review Team**

When resubmitting, you can include this note:

```
Hi Apple Review Team,

Thank you for the feedback on ITMS-90683. We have resolved the issue by adding the missing NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription key to our Info.plist file.

The app now properly declares why it needs photo library access: to allow users (teachers/admins) to select profile pictures for student and teacher accounts within the educational management system.

This functionality is essential for the app's educational purpose of managing student and teacher profiles in schools.

Please let us know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Edu Solution Team
```
