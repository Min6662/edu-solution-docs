# Teacher Subject Assignment Enhancement for Timetable

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
Previously, when a teacher was selected in the timetable, switching between different classes would overwrite the schedule data, causing confusion about which subjects the teacher was assigned to teach for specific classes.

## âœ… Solution Implemented

### 1. **Teacher-Class Subject Mapping**
- Added `_getTeacherAssignedSubjects()` method that fetches subjects from `ClassSubjectTeacher` table
- Shows which specific subjects a teacher is assigned to teach for each class
- Prevents scheduling conflicts by showing only relevant subjects

### 2. **Enhanced Schedule Display**
- **Assigned subjects** are marked with `âœ“` checkmark and shown in **bold font**
- **Other subjects** appear in normal font weight
- **Visual differentiation** between assigned vs. non-assigned subjects

### 3. **Smart Subject Dialog**
- When both teacher and class are selected:
  - Shows **dropdown with teacher's assigned subjects** for that specific class
  - Displays teacher's assignments in a green info box
  - Allows selecting from assigned subjects OR entering custom subjects
  - Prevents accidental overwrites with clear visual indicators

### 4. **Class-Specific Logic**
- When **class is selected**: Shows ALL subjects for that class with teacher names
- When **teacher is selected**: Shows subjects taught by that teacher across all classes
- When **both are selected**: Highlights teacher's specific assignments for that class

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Database Integration
```dart
// Fetches teacher's assigned subjects for specific class
Future<Map<String, String>> _getTeacherAssignedSubjects(String teacherId, String classId)

// Uses ClassSubjectTeacher table:
// - teacher: Pointer to Teacher
// - class: Pointer to Class  
// - subject: Pointer to Subject
// - dayOfWeek: String
```

### Visual Enhancements
```dart
// Assigned subjects marked with checkmark
displayText = isAssignedSubject ? '$subject âœ“' : subject;

// Bold font for assigned subjects
fontWeight: isAssignedSubject ? FontWeight.w700 : FontWeight.w600
```

### User Experience
- **Admin users**: Can see assigned subjects dropdown + custom input
- **Teacher users**: View-only mode with assignment information
- **Conflict prevention**: Clear indicators when overwriting existing assignments

## ðŸŽ® How It Works Now

1. **Select Teacher**: Shows their schedule across all classes
2. **Select Class**: Shows all subjects for that class with teacher names  
3. **Select Both**: 
   - Highlights teacher's specific assigned subjects with âœ“
   - Dialog shows dropdown of assigned subjects
   - Prevents scheduling conflicts
   - Maintains class context when switching

## ðŸ“Š Benefits

- âœ… **Smart subject selection** from teacher's assignments
