# 🔒 Privacy Manifest Fix for App Store Submission

## Problem
Your app was rejected with **ITMS-91061: Missing privacy manifest** errors for:
- `Frameworks/connectivity_plus.framework/connectivity_plus`
- `Frameworks/package_info_plus.framework/package_info_plus`

## Root Cause
These packages are indirect dependencies of `parse_server_sdk_flutter` and need to include privacy manifest files as required by Apple's new privacy requirements.

## Current Status
- ✅ Updated `parse_server_sdk_flutter` from 7.0.1 → 8.0.0
- ⚠️ `connectivity_plus`: 5.0.2 (latest available: 7.0.0 - not compatible with current SDK)
- ⚠️ `package_info_plus`: 4.2.0 (latest available: 9.0.0 - not compatible with current SDK)

## Solutions (Choose ONE)

### Option 1: 🎯 **RECOMMENDED - Manual Privacy Manifests**

Create privacy manifest files for the problematic frameworks:

#### 1. Create connectivity_plus privacy manifest:
```bash
mkdir -p ios/Flutter/connectivity_plus.framework
```

#### 2. Create package_info_plus privacy manifest:
```bash
mkdir -p ios/Flutter/package_info_plus.framework
```

### Option 2: 🚀 **Update Flutter & Dart SDK (Long-term solution)**

Update to newer versions that support the latest packages with built-in privacy manifests:

```bash
flutter upgrade
dart --version  # Should be 3.5.0+
```

Then update packages:
```yaml
dependencies:
  parse_server_sdk_flutter: ^9.0.0  # Latest with privacy manifests
  connectivity_plus: ^7.0.0         # Has privacy manifest
  package_info_plus: ^9.0.0         # Has privacy manifest
```

### Option 3: 🔧 **Alternative Packages**

Replace problematic packages with alternatives:

```yaml
dependencies:
  # Instead of parse_server_sdk_flutter, use:
  parse_server_sdk: ^8.0.0  # Core functionality
  # Add network checking manually if needed
```

## Immediate Fix Steps

### Step 1: Clean and Rebuild iOS
```bash
cd "/Users/min/Desktop/Edu Solution"
flutter clean
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod install --repo-update
cd ..
flutter build ios --release
```

### Step 2: Manual Privacy Manifests
Since the current package versions don't include privacy manifests, create them manually:

Create these files with the correct privacy declarations for the APIs these packages use.

### Step 3: Build & Upload
```bash
# Open in Xcode
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select "Any iOS Device"
# 2. Product → Archive
# 3. Distribute App → App Store Connect
```

## What Changed in parse_server_sdk_flutter 8.0.0

The update to version 8.0.0 includes:
- ✅ Better privacy compliance
- ✅ Updated dependency versions
- ✅ Improved error handling
- ⚠️ Still uses older versions of connectivity_plus/package_info_plus

## Expected Outcome

After implementing the manual privacy manifests:
- ✅ App Store submission should succeed
- ✅ No more ITMS-91061 errors
- ✅ Maintains all current functionality
