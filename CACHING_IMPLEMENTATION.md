# Add Student Screen Caching Implementation

## Caching Features Added:

### 1. **Class List Caching**
- ✅ Cache class list from ClassService to avoid repeated API calls
- ✅ Load cached classes instantly while fetching fresh data in background
- ✅ Auto-update cache when fresh data is available

### 2. **Form Data Caching**
- ✅ Auto-save form data as user types (all text fields)
- ✅ Cache class selections (morning/evening classes)
- ✅ Restore form data when returning to screen (within 24 hours)
- ✅ Auto-clear cache when student is successfully saved

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**
- ✅ Instant class list loading from cache
- ✅ Form data persistence for interrupted sessions
- ✅ Background data refresh for fresh content
- ✅ Smart cache expiration (24 hours for form data)

### 4. **Cache Management**
- ✅ Clear cache button in app bar (debug mode)
- ✅ Auto-clear form cache on successful save
- ✅ Proper cache cleanup on widget disposal
- ✅ Error handling for cache operations

## Cache Storage:

### Cache Box: `addStudentCache`
- `classList` - Array of class objects from ClassService
- `draftFormData` - Form field values and selections with timestamp

### Form Data Cached:
- Student name, grade, address, phone number
- Study status, mother name, father name, place of birth
- Morning class selection, evening class selection
- Timestamp for cache expiration

## Usage:

### For New Students:
1. Form data is automatically saved as user types
2. If user leaves and returns, form data is restored
3. Cache is cleared when student is successfully saved
4. Clear cache button available for manual clearing

### For Editing Students:
1. Class list is cached for faster loading
2. Student data is populated from database (not cache)
3. Form auto-save is disabled for editing mode

## Benefits:

1. **Faster Loading**: Classes load instantly from cache
2. **Data Persistence**: Form data survives app restarts/crashes
3. **Better UX**: No lost work when interrupted
4. **Reduced API Calls**: Cached classes reduce server load
5. **Offline Capability**: Basic form functionality works offline

## Cache Expiration:

- **Class List**: Updates in background, no expiration
- **Form Data**: 24 hours, then auto-cleared
- **Manual Clear**: Clear cache button available for testing

## Testing:

1. Fill out form partially → close app → reopen → data should be restored
2. Add student successfully → form should be cleared
3. Edit existing student → should not restore cached form data
4. Use clear cache button → should clear all cached data with feedback
