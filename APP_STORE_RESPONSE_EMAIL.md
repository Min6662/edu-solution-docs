Dear App Store Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback regarding our app submission (ID: fdcf0750-5323-4c22-84e9-a99ab49bbef3). We have carefully reviewed your concerns and have made significant changes to address both issues raised.

## Response to Guideline 5.1.1(v) - Data Collection and Storage

**Issue:** App supports account creation but lacks account deletion option.

**Resolution:** We have **completely removed public account creation functionality** from the app. This change eliminates the need for account deletion features since users can no longer create accounts through the app interface.

**Technical Changes Made:**
- Removed "Sign Up" buttons from all login screens
- Disabled navigation to registration pages
- Commented out all public account creation code paths

## Response to Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed

**Question:** "Why can a newly created account access the list of students in the Students tab?"

**Resolution:** This issue has been **completely eliminated** by removing public account creation. New accounts can no longer be created by end users.

## App Purpose and Account Management

Our app is an **internal school management system** designed exclusively for educational institutions. The app's intended user base consists of:

- **School Administrators:** Manage all school data and user accounts
- **Teachers:** Track attendance, view assigned classes and students
- **Students:** View their own academic information and attendance

## Current Account Management Model

With the removal of public registration, all user accounts are now:

1. **Created exclusively by school administrators** through backend systems
2. **Pre-authorized and role-assigned** before any access is granted
3. **Limited to verified school personnel and enrolled students** only
4. **Managed centrally** by the educational institution

## Security Benefits

This change provides several security improvements:

- **Eliminates unauthorized access** to student data
- **Ensures all users are pre-verified** by school administration
- **Maintains FERPA compliance** for educational data protection
- **Provides complete audit trail** of all user access

## Data Access Control

Student information is now accessible only to:
- **School administrators** (full access for management purposes)
- **Assigned teachers** (access limited to their own students and classes)
- **Individual students** (access to their own data only)

No unauthorized users can gain access to student data since account creation is no longer available to the public.

## App Store Guidelines Compliance

### Guideline 5.1.1(v) - RESOLVED ✅
- No public account creation = No account deletion requirement needed
- All accounts are institutional accounts managed by administrators
- User data control is handled at the institutional level

### Guideline 2.1 - RESOLVED ✅
- No newly created accounts can access student data
- All accounts are pre-authorized by school administration
- Student data access is restricted to verified school personnel only

## Technical Implementation Summary

The changes ensure that:
1. **No public user registration** is possible through the app
2. **All accounts are administrator-managed** through secure backend processes
3. **Student data remains protected** and accessible only to authorized personnel
4. **App functionality remains intact** for legitimate institutional users

## App Classification

This app should be considered an **internal business/education tool** rather than a consumer application, as it is designed for use exclusively within educational institutions by authorized personnel and enrolled students.

We believe these changes fully address the concerns raised in your review and ensure compliance with App Store guidelines while maintaining the app's core educational management functionality.

Please let us know if you need any additional information or clarification regarding these changes.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
[Moslimin Sun]
